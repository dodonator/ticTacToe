The random KI
The ranom KI simply plays after the python random library

The easy KI
The simple AI observed in which row it has a character and
the opponent does not. It will only set in rows, where not
providing any opponent's piece.

The medium KI
The medium AI does the same as the simple AI, except that
she additionally the opponent blocks, if these two have in
a row.

The heavy KI
Theoretically, the only way to defeat the heavy AI is to set
a trap, so it is possible to win in two fields.
