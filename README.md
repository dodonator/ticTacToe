ticTacToe
=========

A simple bot for tictactoe

tic2.py is the latest program. All programs are at work. bot2.py adapted several bots to benchmark against each other. There has small statistical approaches. The score is composed of the Rounds, the time required to gain the victory. The score ratio represents the percentage of scores at the maximum score of four points is in each round.

TODO:
* all code must be much easier
* a developer version for easy debugging
* a decent documentation in the code and outside the code
* a merger of the two parts bots.py and tic4.py
* OOP
* highscore system
