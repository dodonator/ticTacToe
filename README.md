A simple bot for tictactoe

tic2.py is the latest program. All programs are at work. bot2.py adapted several bots to benchmark against each other. There has small statistical approaches. The score is composed of the Rounds, the time required to gain the winner. The score ratio represents the percentage of scores at the maximum score of four points is in each round.

TODO:
* The KI3 bot is currently my best AI. My only thing missing is a function similar to that danger () function that detects whether a victory in the current round is possible.
